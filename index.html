    <p>My name is Entisar, I am from Ethiopia, a land-locked country at the east side of Africa. I was one of the few lucky people 
    to be granted a sholarship to one of the United World College schools. I was a junior in high school and 16 years old when I heard I had been chosen to
    study an international baccalaureate diploma in Italy for two years.I knew right away that this opportunity was the begining of so many great things
    coming my way. IB diploma was very challenging and demanding but I realized that was how something that's great should be. despite the home sickness and the language barrie,
    I am sure, that is the place that helped me grow into the person I always wanted to be. Not just academic wise, I think its where 
    my understanding of diversity and tolerance came through.</p>
