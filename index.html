             My name is Entisar, I am from Ethiopia, a land-locked country at the east side of Africa. 
    I was one of the few lucky people to be granted a sholarship to one of the United World College schools. 
    I was a junior in high school and 16 years old when I heard I had been chosen to study 
    an international baccalaureate diploma system in Italy for two years.
    I knew right away that this opportunity was the begining of so many great things coming my way.
    IB diploma was very challenging and demanding but I realized that was how something that's great should be.
    despite the home sickness and the language barrier,I am sure, that is the place that helped me grow into 
    the person I always wanted to be. Not just academic wise, I think its also where my understanding of diversity 
    and tolerance started growing.</p>
    <p> After studying for two years in Italy, once again I was lucky to be granted another scholarship 
    to a college in the United States.That's how I came to Luther College in 2013. Currently, I am junior double majoring 
    in Economics and Computer Science.</p>
