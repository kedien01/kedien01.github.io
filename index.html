             <h2> More about me </h2>
            <p> I was one of the few lucky people to be granted a sholarship to one of the United World College schools. 
             I was a junior in high school and 16 years old when I heard I had been chosen to study 
             an international baccalaureate diploma system in Italy for two years.
             I knew right away that this opportunity was the begining of so many great things coming my way.
             IB diploma was very challenging and demanding but I realized that was how something that's great should be.
             despite the home sickness and the language barrier,I am sure, that is the place that helped me grow into 
             the person I always wanted to be. Not just academic wise, I think its also where my understanding of diversity 
             and tolerance started growing.</p>
            <p class="left"> After studying for two years in Italy, once again I was lucky to be granted another scholarship 
            to a college in the United States.That's how I came to Luther College in 2013. Currently, I am junior double majoring 
            in Economics and Computer Science.</p>
