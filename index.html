    <p>My name is Entisar, I am from Ethiopia, a land-locked country at the east side of Africa. I was one of the few lucky people 
    to be granted a sholarship to one of the United World College schools. I was a junior in high school and 16 years old when I heard I had been chosen to
    study an international baccalaureate diploma system in Italy for two years.I knew right away that this opportunity was the begining of so many great things
    coming my way. IB diploma was very challenging and demanding but I realized that was how something that's great should be.
    despite the home sickness and the language barrier,I am sure, that is the place that helped me grow into the person I always wanted to be. Not just academic wise, I think its also
    where my understanding of diversity and tolerance started growing.</p>
    <p> After studying for two years in Italy, once again I was lucky to be granted another scholarship to a college in the United States.
    That's how I came to Luther College in 2013. Currently, I am junior double majoring in Economics and Computer Science.</p>
